Module 5 - Data Visualization homework

In this assignment, I analyzed a (fictional) data set of cancer treatments in mice. Several different applications were used to clean, organize, and visualize the data, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, Scipy, and Scikitlearn. This notebook demonstrates trends in the data with multiple dataframes, bar charts, pie charts, box and whisker plots, a line chart, scatter plots with regression lines, and a violin plot.
